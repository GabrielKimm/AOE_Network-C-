DataStructure

[ Description ]

* Output critical path from an AOE network with n vertex

* Input method
  Number of Vertex (if n, vertex exists from 0 to n-1)
  Number of Edge
  Enter as many pairs as (vertex 1, vertex 2, weighted) as of Edge
  
* Output method
  Edges on which the Critical path is constructed
  When the last event occurs
  
* Operating Example
